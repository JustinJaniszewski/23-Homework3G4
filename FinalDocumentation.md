>**Work Calculation and Testing Script:**

This Python script defines a function for calculating work done by a car as a function of its velocities and mass.
It also includes a test function to ensure the correctness of the work calculation function.


**Steps:**
1) Define a function calculate_work_done(velocities, mass).
2) Calculates the work done by a car based on its velocities and mass.
3) Define parameters.
   velocities (list of float): A list of velocities (in m/s) at different points in time.
   mass (float): The mass of the car (in kilograms).
4) Returns:
    - `work_done` (list of float): A list of work done (in joules) at each point in time.
5) test_calculate_work_done()`: Tests the `calculate_work_done` function to ensure its correctness.

6) Usage:
    1. Defines given data (velocities in mph, conversion factor, mass of car).
    2. Converts velocities from mph to m/s.
    3. Manually calculate the expected work done at each point.
    4. Calls `calculate_work_done` to calculate work done.
    5. Compares the calculated and expected values within a small tolerance.
    6. Prints the calculated work done.
